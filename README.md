## Project Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - The raw pricing data was collected and cleaned to remove inconsistencies and outliers.
   - Adjusted prices were calculated based on relevant factors (e.g., demand, seasonality, competition).

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Exploratory data analysis was performed using Excel dashboards and pivot tables.
   - Key metrics and trends were visualized to identify pricing patterns.

3. **Dynamic Pricing Strategy**
   - Various dynamic pricing models were evaluated.
   - The impact of different variables on price optimization was assessed.

4. **Results Interpretation**
   - Insights were summarized in the dashboard and pivot tables.
   - Recommendations were documented in the summary and conclusion files.
